 *  If you are linking to Urho3D dynamically, then it is possible that the
 *  current version will be different than the version you compiled against.
 *  This function returns the current version, while URHO3D_VERSION() is a
 *  macro that tells you what version you compiled with.
 *
 *  \code
 *  UrhoVersion compiled;
 *  UrhoVersion linked;

 *  URHO3D_VERSION(&compiled);
 *  ::Urho3D::GetVersion(&linked);
 *  printf("We compiled against Urho3D version %d.%d.%d ...\n",
